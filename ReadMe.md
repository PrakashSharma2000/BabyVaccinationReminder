# Baby Vaccination Reminder App

## What made me do this ü§î?
Hi Myself Prakash Sharma, I was a Mtech student when I made this project. This project comes from an idea of how to track the vaccination schedules of a newborn, as vaccination is one of the most crucial parts of a baby's development. So I made this (haha), it was an idea of my Supervisor because I wanted to make an app for Stray animals but that's a different story.

## How to use it? üòÅ

To basic right yup what you can expect from a non-artist guy but it is what it is.

* Now here we can see the list of vaccines
* Upcoming vaccination dates and list.
* and a tiny button to update the status.

Once you click on the wonder magic button it pop up few entries for you.

* Now here you have to give the hospital name from where you took the vaccine I mean your baby.
* And Date as well. That also will update the upcoming dates of vaccines as well if you took the vaccine on scheduled dates.
